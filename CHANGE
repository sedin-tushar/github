```solution design and implementation approach:

1. Use Amazon S3 for Storage
Store the index.json file and the blog markdown files (filename1.md, file2.md) in an S3 bucket.
Use S3 bucket policies to manage permissions for reading and writing files.
2. Form Submission (Front-End):
Use a simple HTML form to submit content (both index.json and markdown files).
For file uploads, use JavaScript (AWS SDK for JavaScript or HTML5 FormData).
3. API Endpoints (Back-End)
Implement an API using Node.js (Express) to expose the contents of index.json and the markdown files.
Use JWT Authentication to secure the endpoints.
4. Authentication
Use JWT tokens for user authentication.
Users will be required to authenticate (e.g., using username and password) to receive a JWT token.
This token will be used to authorize requests to the API.
5. File Writing to S3
Upon form submission, use AWS SDK to upload the form data (new markdown content and index.json) to S3.
6. File Reading via API
Implement an API to allow authenticated users to fetch the index.json and the markdown files (filename1.md, file2.md, etc.) from S3.```
